Abstract
Decarbonisation of all sectors is needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change. To accomplish this, hydrogen use has been suggested in many industries that currently rely on fossil fuels. However, the emissions intensity of hydrogen depends on how it is produced and distributed. Excess use of hydrogen could increase global emissions compared to alternative decarbonisation options such as electrification with renewables. This leaves the optimal role of hydrogen unclear. Here, we systematically compare the decarbonisation potential of global hydrogen supply chains. 37,000 configurations of supply chain from primary energy production through to end-use are considered. We find that for all applications which can be electrified, direct use of renewable power would lead to greater emissions savings than use of hydrogen. Therefore, the lowest total emissions are enabled by a combined electrification and hydrogen scenario, leading to a maximum of 280 Mt CO2e/a reduction in the sectors considered. Use of imported hydrogen lowers the maximum emissions reduction to 240 Mt CO2e/a. Based on the emissions reduction per unit of renewable energy, electrification of heating and road transport should be prioritised in the UK, with low emission hydrogen use focused on replacing grey hydrogen in the short term.
